LIBRARY ATTENDANCE SYSTEM - SETUP GUIDE

Follow these steps to run the project on your computer.

=== PREREQUISITES ===
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
   Type `python --version` in your terminal to check.

=== STEP 1: SETUP FOLDER ===
1. Download the code and unzip it (or clone the repository).
2. Open the folder in your code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).
3. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt inside this folder.

=== STEP 2: CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT ===
It is best practice to use a virtual environment so libraries don't conflict.

For Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

For Mac/Linux:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

(You should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal line).

=== STEP 3: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES ===
Run this command to install Django, QR code generator, and other tools:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

=== STEP 4: SETUP DATABASE ===
Since the database isn't shared for privacy, you need to create a local one:

   python manage.py migrate

=== STEP 5: CREATE ADMIN ACCOUNT ===
To access the dashboard, you need an admin account:

   python manage.py createsuperuser

(Enter a username and password when prompted. You can skip the email).

=== STEP 6: CONFIGURE EMAIL (OPTIONAL) ===
If you want the system to send QR codes via email:
1. Open `library_project/settings.py`.
2. Scroll to the bottom to find `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`.
3. Replace 'REPLACE_WITH_APP_PASSWORD' with your own Gmail App Password.
   (Note: You need 2-Step Verification enabled on Google to generate an App Password).
4. Update `EMAIL_HOST_USER` with your Gmail address.

=== STEP 7: RUN THE SYSTEM ===
Start the server:

   python manage.py runserver

=== STEP 8: ACCESS ===
1. Open your browser.
2. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
3. Login with the superuser account you created in Step 5.
