LIBRARY ATTENDANCE SYSTEM - SETUP GUIDE

Follow these steps to run the project on your computer.

=== PREREQUISITES ===
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
   Type `python --version` in your terminal to check.

=== STEP 1: SETUP FOLDER ===
1. Download the code and unzip it (or clone the repository).
2. Open the folder in your code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).
3. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt inside this folder.

=== STEP 2: CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT ===
It is best practice to use a virtual environment so libraries don't conflict.

For Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

For Mac/Linux:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

(You should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal line).

=== STEP 3: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES ===
Run this command to install Django, QR code generator, and other tools:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

=== STEP 4: SETUP DATABASE ===
NOTE: The system is configured for PostgreSQL by default.
Option A (Recommended): Install PostgreSQL and create a database named 'library_db'.
Option B (Easier): Open `library_project/settings.py` and switch the DATABASES setting back to SQLite.

Once configured, run:

   python manage.py migrate

=== STEP 5: PREPARE STATIC FILES ===
To ensure logos and styles load correctly in production:

   python manage.py collectstatic
   (Type 'yes' if asked to overwrite).

=== STEP 6: CREATE ADMIN ACCOUNT ===
To access the dashboard, you need an admin account:

   python manage.py createsuperuser

(Enter a username and password when prompted. You can skip the email).

=== STEP 7: CONFIGURE EMAIL (OPTIONAL) ===
If you want the system to send QR codes via email:
1. Open `library_project/settings.py`.
2. Scroll to the bottom to find `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`.
3. Replace 'REPLACE_WITH_APP_PASSWORD' with your own Gmail App Password.
   (Note: You need 2-Step Verification enabled on Google to generate an App Password).
4. Update `EMAIL_HOST_USER` with your Gmail address.

=== STEP 8: RUN THE SYSTEM ===
You have two ways to run the system:

Option A: Production Mode (Recommended for Library)
   python run_production.py

Option B: Development Mode
   python manage.py runserver

=== STEP 9: ENABLE CAMERA (NGROK) ===
To make the camera work on phones and other laptops:

1. Download Ngrok (https://ngrok.com/download) and put `ngrok.exe` in this folder.
2. Open a NEW terminal window.
3. Run:
   ngrok http 8000
4. Copy the link ending in `.ngrok-free.app` (e.g., https://a1b2.ngrok-free.app).
5. Use that link on any device to access the system with camera support.

=== STEP 10: ACCESS ===
1. Open your browser.
2. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or your Ngrok link)
3. Login with the superuser account you created in Step 5.
